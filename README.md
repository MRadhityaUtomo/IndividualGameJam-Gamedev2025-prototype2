POST UAS NOTE:
There is a bug found on lower framerates, the boss can get stuck and for a period of time before actually firing the burst. Tested both with lower and high framerate on my device and it seems it is based on framerate.
It could be because of the await but changing it to process frame also does nothing for the bug. In the time, both for the github version or the itch version please try to run it with high fps, until I can find a solution.
[THIS POST IS FOR NOTICE ONLY, SKIPPING FOR UAS GRADING IS FINE, SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.]
